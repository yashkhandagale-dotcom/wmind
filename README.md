### **Step 5: Start InfluxDB Only**

```bash
docker compose up -d influxdb
```

### **Step 6: Initialize InfluxDB**

1. Open: **http://localhost:8086**
2. Create username & password
3. Set organization: `Wonderbiz`
4. Create bucket: `signals`
5. Generate API token

### **Step 7: Update `.env`**

```env
INFLUX_TOKEN=<generated-token>
INFLUX_ORG=Wonderbiz
INFLUX_BUCKET=SignalValueTeleMentry
```

### **Step 8: Start All Services**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### **Step 9: Access Services**

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| 🌐 **Frontend** | http://localhost:5000 |
| 🐰 **RabbitMQ UI** | http://localhost:15672 | 
| ⏱️ **InfluxDB UI** | http://localhost:8086 |
| 📊 **vector DB** | http://localhost:6333 |
